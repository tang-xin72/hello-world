# hello-world
a test repository for DSC520 class
# Hi, DSC520 class, my name is **XIN TANG**
1. I am a professional with many years of experience and have a master degree.  but I have almost zero experience in coding and R. 
2. I deal with quality control so I know a little bit of statistics, but the field I am working on does not deal with big data and tight on IP control, so we do not handle much statistical analysis often. I am excited to learn more on how to use R to do statistics. 
3. hope this study is rewarding and fun ðŸ˜‚
4. I live in Texas, am married with 2 tennagers living with me. I travel quite often but will find time to this important class. 
# Look forward to learn together and from all of you!
